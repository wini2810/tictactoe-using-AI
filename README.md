***Tic Tac Toe using AI ***


This code is a game called 'Tic Tac Toe' which is developed using AI techniques. There are two methods for implementing this AI i.e AI:random and AI:smart. 

AI:random learns from each game starting with maxDepth=2 and gets better in every next game. 

AI:smart works with maxDepth=7 i.e it plays a perfect game to beat Human. 

This code is developed using JavaScript. There are three different files of JavaScript :
   
	1. tictactoe.js - This file specifies GUI functionalities and selection of AI methods.

	2. ai.js - This file specifies the main logic behind AI that plays the game with some intelligence.

	3. board.js - This file draws the board which are simply integers. Hence, bitwise operations are used to draw the board.

To run the code, simply run tictactoe.html in any browser.
